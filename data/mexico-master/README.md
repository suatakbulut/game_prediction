# Intro

Free open public domain football data (football.db)
for Mexico / North America


## Build Your Own `mexico.db` Copy

Try in your working folder (that is, `/mexico`):

```
$ sportdb build
$ sportdb --verbose build     # or for more (verbose) details incl. debug info
```

This will

- setup a new single-file SQLite database e.g. `./sport.db`
- read in all datasets in plain text (`.txt`)

That's it.
